# Basic-block-game
click to jump over one block, this is a game to help me understand how to interconnect javascript, css, and html. Its's a very basic beginner friendly program.
I am also not sure how to make it into a small file instead of individual sheets, if you do let me know, I am brand new to github. 
If there is any information you can provide to help me become a better programmer please do leave a comment, also if there was a better way to code anything and
simplify it please let me know as well.
